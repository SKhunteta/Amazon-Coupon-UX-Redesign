# Amazon-Coupon-UX-Redesign
A redesign of Amazon's coupons system inclusively designed for low income users.

This GitHub repository shows the .bmpr files of both the Low-Fi Prototype and the final Prototype, designed for Margaret Burnett's Inclusive Design class at Oregon State University.

In addition, this repository contains the personas of both the target population (low-income users) and the mainstream population.
